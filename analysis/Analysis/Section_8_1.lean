# Analysis I, Section 8.1: Countability

I have attempted to make the translation as faithful a paraphrasing as possible of the original
text. When there is a choice between a more idiomatic Lean solution and a more faithful
translation, I have generally chosen the latter. In particular, there will be places where the
Lean code could be "golfed" to be more elegant and idiomatic, but I have consciously avoided
doing so.

Main constructions and results of this section:

- Custom notions for "equal cardinality", "countable", and "at most countable".  Note that Mathlib's
`Countable` typeclass corresponds to what we call "at most countable" in this text.
- Countability of the integers and rationals.

Note that as the Chapter 3 set theory has been deprecated, we will not re-use relevant constructions from that theory here, replacing them with Mathlib counterparts instead.
